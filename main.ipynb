      "['This was a real page turner.  Debbie has an epiphany of sorts when she is on the set with her latest adult film. Returning home, she discovers her husband has died with a underaged girl. The two were electrocuted while filming the girl\\'s \"audition\" in a hot tub. Only this could happen in Hollywood. Debbie is left with a huge debt of her husband\\'s and a local thug named Richard Ness is threatening to kill her if she doesn\\'t make good on the debt. Debbie, feisty and strong, pretty much tells him where to go. She decides she\\'s had enough of the adult film industry and wants out. She embarks on a journey to reconnect with her family while planning her husband\\'s funeral. One would think her late husband was a dog, but it turns out he really cared for Debbie and was kind to her. For all his flaws, he was a decent husband. Ness sells her debt to a mean thug named Coco Manetti, who tries to collect any way possible. Luckily Debbie discovers she has an unexpectedly powerful friend on her side who ends up helping her out.The characters are colorful and well-developed. I like the fact there\\'s a gay character who loves theater; you might think he\\'s a stereotype, but he ends up being far from that once you learn more about him. You can just visualize them from Mosley\\'s descriptions. Although a bit raw at times, Debbie\\'s story has a gritty realness but in the end, she manages to triumph, but not in the way you might expect. I like how Debbie evolves and grows during the story; in spite of what happens, she remains strong and committed to starting a new life. This story draws you in right from the start, and like me, you won\\'t be able to put it down once you start.', \"I liked the premise, the waitress who loved to read meeting the professor, but after the first literary &#34;meet cute&#34; session in the diner, they never discuss literature again until almost the book's ending. So it was just a ruse to put two people together. Once established as a lover of literature, Meghan never talks about it until she mentions &#34;Moby Dick,&#34; and that doesn't move much. Once she got to college, NOTHING is said about it until she's meeting some people - but NOTHING is said about what might excite her in the classroom, the books she reads, the professors, nothing until a conversation until she's supposed to be drunk in the scene toward the end - simply a device again. Also, little thought was given to the pressures of her work/school situation - being a waitress is hard work, but here it seems a device just to get her to meet ol' Grey, who has to rescue her from herself (sigh). The motivation for a key scene was also missing, which seemed like sloppy editing, but I won't go into it here. The actual writing sounded as if Macomber had never read Shakespeare or Spenser or &#8230;anyone but other Harlequin writers.Meghan was simply unbelievable - she spoke with too much formal language (this could have been an interesting device with the character being criticized for her style of speech, but Macomber seems completely unaware of this). Grey's character is also, in the end, not credible. It's all &#34;romantic realism&#34; in the worst sense, just going for the scene payoffs without any relationship with reality. The characters meet, have second thoughts, break up, have misunderstandings, oh yawn.I wish it had worked. It was a nice idea. It's a cause of some despair that the readers don't seem to require much effort on the part of Ms. Macomber, who can certainly do better than this. She gave herself such opportunities to do something quite interesting here, but failed to do anything at all for anyone. So it was not my thing - it asked nothing of me and gave no insight into any characters at all. Macomber just seems to be rolling this one out for some not very demanding readers. Wow. And they gobble it up. Wow.\", \"Just google Robert Frost. The money isn't going to any related to Frost. It is all public domain because it was published before 1923.

The first book drew me into the series and Allegiant ends this series quite well. I recommend reading these books.', \"I don't think a whole lot of Beth Moore books. I find them uninspiring and rather boring. Total waste of hard earned money!\", 'i never read it', \"This may be a good book but I haven't been able to get into it- and it is small and short.  I am a prodigious reader of many genre, but just didn't like this at all.\", \"Novel is set in the war years, 1941-5.  Protagonist Bob Jones, a black ship yard worker--and human time bomb--is at war with the white world and with himself. Seemingly pathologically oversensitive, and obviously on the make, Bob is hard to like or empathize with.  The novel bogs down at mid-point, the language increasingly prosaic, and plods forward somewhat interminably. As description of the LA ship yards during the war, the book's sociological value may equal the literary.  Overly serious--a not atypical defect for a first novel--the book is without a hint of the humor commonly found in Himes's later work. W.F. Burke, author, WRITERS LEFT OF CENTER, Shires Press, 2008.\", 'The whole series is a wonderful read.  You get so into the book, the end comes so quickly. A+ A+', 'I found this book to be painfully slow.  I had a very hard time finishing it and often found I would scan complete chapters just to move it along.  Even then there was so much repeat that if I had missed something I would read it again two or three more times later in the book...  UGH.', \"I'm completely shocked that this was the ending to this series.  I loved the first two especially the love between four and tris it was exciting to see how they were so different but still loved one another thru it all.  I can not believe tris died and it was just like well that's it.  All the bad people got off for all they done while in my opinion the best character who done as much as she could for the people dies.  And a stupid death at that. She was finally happy to live and stopped going on suicide missions for the life and love she wanted.  But guess what nope didn't happen all the bad people got the life she help create but she got nothing.  I love romance stories but I also love action.. if your going to bring a romance into a book so strongly than don't disappoint.  Just really feel like blah over the ending just horrible!!!!\", \"This is a novella which is a prequel to Elemental Hunger. Elana creates the most interesting worlds in her books and I love the richness and depth to them.  Her characters are complex and interesting to read about. I am often surprised and am always sucked into the story and can't put it down until the end. The main character in this story is a wind elemental, but he is hiding it from his brother and most people that know him. It will be interesting to see what he does with it in the future. I am very much a lover of romance and so I was sad when there wasn't any in this book, but I am sure there will be in the next one. I will let you know when I am finished reading it.\", \"Part three was amazing. I am so glad I own the whole series, and can't wait to get back to Pennsylvania. I recommend this to fans of well-written sci-fi.\", \"a  lot of things didn't make sense in this book.  I tried to keep up with the constant change of characters but finally got tired of rereading previous pages to try to keep up.  it was like Abbott and Costello and Whose On First.  The writing reminded me of that of someone in a high school writing class.  Sorry but the author needs practice.  The idea of his book was very good, just poorly executed.\", \"I couldn't finish this book.  The writing is so stilted and juvenile that I couldn't look past it.  To bad - the premise sounded good.  What a waste.\", \"This isn't the kind of book I would normally read.  But a close friend asked that I read it.  I am glad I did.  It's that kind of book that begs to be discussed with others,\", 'Maybe the title is a direction for how best to read this book?I bought this book because of all the great reviews over on Amazon. Reviews that said such things as \"a real love story at last\"...I\\'m guessing these are the same people that enjoyed Madame Bovary in college.The author tries for a clever stylized book that never achieves even a modicum of greatness. I\\'m not sure the writer liked Judith, but I\\'m sure I did not like her! The story is told in a past present mix. The first part gets tedious because you have one chapter of Judith in the present, realizing she is unhappy with her life, but not quite sure why, and then you have a chapter of young Judith, a glimpse of how she got to where she is. It goes back and forth like that. Then in part two (yes the author has created three parts)you mostly get young Judith. She is not an unpleasant kid, but she is kind of snotty and places herself above others. Typical teen. When present day Judith wonders about her own teen daughters tendency toward unpleasantness I want to tell her to look in the mirror!Young Judith falls for an older boy. When they start dating she is about 17 and he is at least 21, maybe 22. He is a boy who went to high school, played basketball, and now does carpentry because he doesn\\'t want to work his fathers farm. He is a pretty simple guy who is going to live and die in the midwest town he was born in. We know he is folksy and common because the author tells us he pronounces \"Periwinkle\" as \"Perry Winkle\" which was not the first time I scratched my head and said wtf? But he is exceedingly kind and has some real insight into the nature of what makes people tick. Willy is a truly likeable person. But Judith wants to shake the dust of Rufus Sage off her feet, she is meant for something more. So when she gets into Stanford, she takes the opportunity, never looking back at Rufus Sage or Willy.So now she is an unsatisfied adult wondering what became of Willy her first love, and Deena and Patrick, the only two people she could call friends in Rufus Sage.I could never care about Judith. There was nothing compelling about her. Mostly I wanted to slap her. I loved Willy and thought she was an idiot for never really seeing who he was.At it\\'s best, I guess it\\'s a story that shows you can\\'t go back and that you have to accept the choices you make. But that\\'s me reaching for something good to say. A grand love story it most definitely is not!', 'I have to agree with Mark D.R. - page after endless page of unnecessary minutia.  I too started skipping pages just to get to some kind of event other than perpetual hiking and commenting on the scenery.  The story is told in the first person, than abrubtly changes to 3rd person to describe the apparent death of one character, back to first person.  The reader is told what happens, but the main characters have no idea.Not very good story telling overall, and after having read 35% of the book, still no real clue where the story is heading.  On the up side, it does help put me to sleep at night.', \"It's a sad commentary on this book that I literally cannot even remember what  it was about.  I waited too long and have no recollection! So sorry, just know it wasn't memorable, thats for sure.\", \"What kind of a society have we become that casually using the F-word in our stories is now mainstream? I hate it! It is a vulgar, nasty word. This is the 4th book this week I have started to read that casually uses the word. Why? For dramatic flair? To show your readers your unlimited vocabulary? To me, it just proves that the author wasn't able to come up with something more intelligent. I now hear foul language in the grocery store, in restaurants, walking down the streets, in our schools, it's everywhere! Why can't I sit down and enjoy a good story without it? We are bombarded with it everyday. Please keep it out of books! Please.\", 'This book should come w with a \"R\" reading. There where some funny parts but they where way over shadows by the trash.', \"I am a Born Again Christian who regularly debates atheists on Google+ about all things Christian.  I was hoping to find something of use in this book but I was disappointed.  As was said in another review, you can't start out with unfounded facts then &#34;prove&#34; your point with only a few, ridiculous arguments against.  This wouldn't work in a courtroom nor does it in religious debate.\", 'Asia&#8217;s Cauldron by Robert D. KaplanReviewed by Andy McKinneyRobert D. Kaplan currently works for the famed intelligence firm, Stratfor.  He acts in the capacity of chief geopolitical analyst.  He has in the past worked in the Pentagon under Secretary of Defense Robert Gates.  In his academic life he taught at the US Naval Academy at Annapolis.  He has served as a senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security in Washington D.C.  He has authored some 15 books including perhaps most famously &#8220;The Revenge of Geography&#8221;.  He is considered by Foreign Policy Magazine as among the 100 Global Thinkers, a group of intellects that help to shape the fate of the world.  He knows his oats.In &#8220;Asia&#8217;s Cauldron-The South China Sea and the end of a Stable Pacific&#8221; he explains the background for the seemingly daily news reports of contention in that body of water.  The bordering nations are China in the north, Viet Nam in the West and the Philippines in the East.  Other interested countries include Malaysia and Singapore.  Tiny Brunei also has an interest in the sea.The current value of the South China Sea resides in its use as a highway for tens of thousands of passing freighters and tankers.  A very large proportion of the world&#8217;s trade sails through this body of water.  China is naturally interested in seeing the oil that fuels its economy sails unfettered to Chinese ports.  The giant container ships that take vast amounts of cargo to and from China are also of a first order of importance.Each of the bordering nations has a unique history with the sea and a specific set of claims and hopes.  Viet Nam is a large, populous nation with a very long coastline bordering the South China Sea.  Chinese and Vietnamese ships come into dangerous proximity around the disputed islands, shoals and barely visible rocks on a regular basis.  Recently a Vietnamese boat was sunk in disputed water.  As Chinese wealth grows, Chinese ability to build a bigger and more modern Navy also grows.  This fact is not lost on Viet Nam.  Viet Nam has recently acquired six modern diesel/electric submarines to be at least something of a counter weight to China&#8217;s incursions, incursions from the Vietnamese viewpoint that the Chinese view as natural as we view US ships in the Gulf of Mexico.Malaysia, an odd hodgepodge of a country, a relic of British Colonialism, also has submarines.  In Malaysia&#8217;s case the subs are two very modern French developed boats.  She has them stationed in the far North East of the country, in Sabath.  The home port of the subs is within easy sailing distance of the Spartlys.  This is no coincidence.The hapless Philippines have neither the money nor the national will to do more than protest China&#8217;s occupation of specs of dry land that are hundreds of miles from China but are within spitting distance of the Philippines.Taiwan, Brunei and even Singapore all have an interest in the area.  All of the smaller states have an interest in not gradually becoming engulfed in the behemoth to the north.  Viet Nam and the Philippines are populous nations and Viet Nam at least is growing and modernizing quickly.  But China is huge by comparison and ambitious to establish sovereignty over as much of the area as she possibly can.  And China has the military means to make its opinions felt.The USA is the only possible counter weight to Chinese naval presence.  The US Navy has visiting rights with the littoral states and visits are increasing dramatically.We might expect Kaplan, an academic and a scholar, to have a ponderous writing style, but it is not the case.  He brilliantly outlines the various contending viewpoints.  He brings us to a deeper and broader understanding of the national histories and the national cultures of the contending nations.  He uses great minds from ancient Greece to modern Singapore to flesh out the grander principles involved.But at the end of the day the contention is about resources.  20% of commercial fish landings worldwide happen in the contested sea.  There is some oil and natural gas beneath its waters and littoral nations hope for more.  It is one of great seaways of the world, and one that China depends upon.  And China is swiftly building the means to overawe the other smaller, poorer and definitely less powerful bordering countries.&#8220;Asia&#8217;s Cauldron&#8221; by Robert D. Kaplan finishes not with a prediction but rather with a range of possible outcomes.  Readers with an interest in world affairs will find their knowledge base strengthened.  This is a book to be studied, absorbed and to be taken very seriously.', 'Not anne tylers type of book at all. Depressing and no up side to the story, Guess I should have known that from the title huh? lol', \"The cover of this book is very well done and my hat off to the artist! The book itself does not live up to the cover, however, and could use a much better editor. Alas, it could use a much better writer as well, as it is very clumsily written by an author with a poor grasp of writing mechanics. Don't believe those five star reviews! Admire the cover, but don't buy this book.\", \"Cardboard people, stilted conversations.  Poorly written with very little continuity between scenes and not much understanding of people.  Wouldn't buy any others in this series.\", 'I enjoyed this book even with the religious overtone. The story was an easy read, the characters likable and drew me in.', \"Having this book toted as a YA series on Amazon and shelved in the Teen section at book stores is very deceiving.  My daughter and I both enjoyed the first book and we both looked forward to reading this second book, Endless Knights, as well. I borrowed this book from my daughter before she had a chance to read it and I'm glad I did.  Not because it is a great story, but because of the sex within.Maybe my opinions do not sit with the majority but I don't believe my teen needs to be fed such descriptions of a sexual act that was depicted in this book.  Instead of quoting the author's story and chancing a child reading this review, I would suggest you go to a book store and read page 115 before purchasing for your child if this type of thing is uncomfortable for them.  I stopped reading after page 157, as it just began to seem like a good story idea that was lost due to the unnecessary graphic nature.  In reading some reviews before I wrote this, I find that there are additional sex scenes with the main character and a different man.  I strongly feel that if publishers want to push books into the YA category, there should be a similar rating on them as movies and video games.  Why can't the publisher give the young adult consumer the heads up about explicit sexual content?  I don't feel that a young reader should be left to innocently stumble upon something so uncomfortable for them.\", \"i READ THROUGH THE WHOLE THING BY FORCE TO SEE IF IT WOULD END UP BETTER BUT IT DIDN'T.  YECK\", 'At first I was a little creeped out because the girl in the story was part demon but the author does a great job of explaining it and making it less creepy.  I enjoyed the story it was pretty entertaining.  I am working on the second book in the series and so far its a good read too.', 'Loved how this series ended! Wish there were more books in this series! I would recommend reading all three books.', \"This is a very imaginative and interesting book. I couldn't put it down. I loved the characters, people lost in a time and place making do with the unimaginable. Has some of the feel and edge of Dune but very different. My only problems were that there is no explanation of why their world is what it is, and the story just ends leaving you hanging and looking for more. I am eagerly looking for the sequel and some possible closure.\", 'I finish most books for the sake of the money I spent. I did not finish this one  since everything reads as a story that the author himself does not believe. Too complex and unorganized.', \"It's more of a autobiography of the writer with small parts when she shares about her experience with Bigfoot.  Not what I had expected at all, couldn't finish it because it became so strange.  I'll give the writer an A for imagination.\", 'Very good light read. Good for a rainy day of reading and fill in before you settle in for another epic big series.', \"This is probably the biggest disappointment in purchasing a book I have ever made.

I&#8217;m going to try hard not to give anything away. Basically Merry is pregnant with twins and her uncle is claiming that they are his.I like Merry and I don&#8217;t mind all her men because I&#8217;ve gotten used to her having several men in her life. I didn&#8217;t expect that to change with the aspect of children entering her life. I like all the guys they each have their own unique story and fit for her. However my favorite is Lord Sholto he has such a tortured soul story he&#8217;s just my favorite.I&#8217;ve been waiting for what seems like forever for the book and I understand the author just wasn&#8217;t ready to write it yet. I love the author I&#8217;ve read almost all of her books but Anita started to lack in story so I stopped. I feel like maybe my expectations were too high for the book, so that when it came time to read it I found myself very disappointed. I love that we get to see a new side to Merry and her men but I guess I needed more action it just felt very flat not a lot happened. I also disliked the ending it reminded me of Game of Thrones. I honestly wanted to love the book I just didn&#8217;t it feel short on so many levels. At the moment I don&#8217;t plan on continuing the series but that could always change Merry has been one of my favorite characters forever.

I hope these are the types of questions on the new standardized test as the current FCAT test is worded in odd ways which is difficult for children whose brains are not developed yet, to understand.  It will be good as extra work after school as it's short and to the point.\", 'Originally, I got this book because it sounded like a bubbly story of a boy with depression. I think that is very accurate of the book. The book was wonderfully written. One of the best aspects of it was how relatable it was. You may wonder how you a mentally stable person could relate; the relating came through being stuck in a cycle. In the book, Craig just got stuck and he did not see an outlet out of his life. Though it meant tearing down his previous life, Craig  found a way out which would make him a hero to most people. Not only is this story heartwarming in the sense that the main character got his life back together, it gives us hope for our own lives.Though your life may not be the best, this book will surely remind you of how lucky you are and the importance of appreciating your current life. I was thoroughly impressed with the complex thought provoking nature achieved through this book. Though written very comically and lighthearted, It&#8217;s Kind of a Funny Story teaches you to respect those with depression and gives more of an understanding.Noted at the back of the book is the information that this book was written soon after the author got out of a mental hospital himself. This really gives even more perspective when reading it. I wish I had known while reading the book.I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a comical story of hope. This book is not just for teens. Many adults could gain insight and enjoy this book.', \"I have not read this so can only comment on the description and other reviews. This sounds like book written by a dhimmi for dhimmi readers. An uncritical study of Islam. For the truth read the Koran and see for yourself that the 'religion of peace' is a lie. It is a religion of sanctioned murder, racism, and hatred. You dont believe me? Then read it and see for yourself.\", \"I was confused while reading this book.  I kept wondering if I was rereading parts that I had read already.  Didn't like it at all.

I love to expose my children to people who are living inspiring lives.  Kilham's understanding of the working of the black bear's mind was fascinating for us all and we loved getting to know the individual bears.

The changing of points of view were very distracting as this author writes Drake and Chloe very much alike. Mannerisms, nuances, etc. The actions/reactions were cliche' and predictable.

The writing style, even within the individual accounts (father, son, granddaughter) is inconsistent and varies from plodding to wooden with large chunks of dialog written in a pedantically stylized manner (\"I suspect you are mistaken\" (p.421) that bear little reality to any concept of everyday speech patterns. Of course this may be deliberate on the part of the author but comes across as an affectation in much the same way as his irritating habit of interspersing the sections on the Comanche Indians with actual words and phrases from their language without providing any translation. The story, if there actually is one, is weak with a tad too much of poetical metaphysics and abject self pity especially in the wimpy son. This is a pity as the author appears to have spent a lot of time in researching his subject matter. The gory descriptions of Comanche torture are sadistic and formulaic adding little to anything. At times the author moves his wooden speech patterns in the Comanche sections (Eli\\'s story) to a more casual argot that could well be derived from 21st century rap vernacular which is yet another artifice.

It is 1923, and Rose records testimonies that no women should have to hear.  With Rose's background as a orphan, being raised by nuns, and having to work hard for everything she has, she takes nothing for granted and follows all the rules of society.  That is until Odalie, the new typist at the precinct walks into her life.  Odalie lives in a fancy hotel, has men falling at her feet, and gets everything she wants with a wink of her eye.  Rose immediately falls under Odalie's spell and their friendship turns Rose into someone she no longer recognizes.Now, I have to stop here, after my brief synopsis of the book and tell you that I did not finish the book.  I tried.  I gave it several hours and days.  I got to Chapter 9 and page 130 and I just couldn't go any farther. This doesn't happen to me very often because I really feel like I am a pretty good judge of &#34;book character&#34;. But, this one just didn't do it for me.  I was bored and felt like I was forced to read.  I have a &#34;rule&#34; that if I'm not enjoying my reading, I need to quit the book because I have too many other books to read.So, with that in mind, I can only offer you that hundreds of other people have LOVED this book. There are rave reviews for THE OTHER TYPIST. There are also several others who have felt the same way I did.  But, as a book blogger, I am not going to lie or tell you that I liked something when I didn't. It just didn't work for me.Some things I did like though were the author's character descriptions.  I had no trouble imagining Rose or Odalie, the Sergeant or the Lieutenant Detective, or Dotty and Helen from the boarding house where Rose lived.  Rindell's details of the 1920's, the expectations of women, and descriptions of those trying to break out of those expectations depicted an era that showed how difficult it was for Rose to find a way to fit in.  Even though I couldn't find a way to be interested in the story, I found several quotes from the book that I enjoyed.If it were not for the fact that they need so much typing done and cannot do it themselves, there would be no women employed at all. The typewriter is indeed my passport into a world otherwise barred to me and my kind.  Page 3So it's strange to me that with Odalie, I suddenly found myself breaking the rules I had once held in such precious regard....The thing about rules is that when you break one, it is only a matter of time before you break more, and the severe architecture that once protected you is destined to come crashing down about your ears.

Throughout characters die unnecessarily and horribly and the ending is depressing enough to make one sorry for having slogged through this book's horrors.I find it disturbing that the author, representing what passes for our culture's best and brightest, found it necessary to invent so much cruelty and, also, in the end, kill off one of the characters who was emblematic of why the war was fought at all.  The book's ending makes it clear that for our culture's elites, life is a constant series of wars between equally amoral titans, wherein normal people serve as nothing more than instruments for the titans' ambitions.Disturbing as well is the implication arising from the book's ending that a coal miner's offspring can never become accomplished enough to earn themselves a place among the Capitol's elites, because it makes available to them just two possibilities: try and die, or return home broken in body and spirit.  Only a character with no compunction about killing innocents can merit a move from lowly District 12 to the Capitol-connected District 2.Unless they make some serious changes to the ending in the movie, I have no desire to see the movies that will be made based on this book.\", \"Great book.

This allows him to spend most of the book telling his story, and he does that well.Once again, Mr. Nuttall has written a fiction book that seems to be based in reality.  I find it easy to imagine how the world could have evolved in the manner he describes.  He goes into enough detail to interest me, without ever boring me.

At the most you would use -1 cup of liquid for 2 cups of flour. This biscuit recipe is incorrect and will yield a liquid doughy mess. The second mistake I noticed was in the grits/egg casserole on page 23. They use 1 cup of quick grits, with 2 cups of water and 2 cups of milk.

Anderson Dune books are quite polarizing. After having read the final book in this series, I find some of the criticism valid. But it's also clear that the authors did try to flesh out the Dune universe in a way that would satisfy Frank Herbert. They're clearly not quite as good with the art of writing, but the books aren't trash.As I've noted in my reviews of the other Dune House books, there is a lot of repetition and lack of subtlety in the writing. I'm not sure if this is because the book had two authors, but the book repeats itself as if worrying readers will forget. In House Corrino, I found the biggest problem to be that the book had too many disparate and sometimes interwoven plots, but little to make me care about many of them. By the middle of the book, you have dozens of characters running around starting wars, having babies, scheming, etc. The chapters are quite short, meaning that you jump around these various subplots quite a bit because every single subplot seems to climax at the same time. This happens a lot in Star Wars books and frustrates me to no end.And if you've read Dune, you know that none of it matters. Of course, this is an inherent risk with any Prequel as it's almost impossible to surprise the audience. But this is why authors who try to pen a prequel should focus on building character and depth than on plot twists. We know what has to happen, so why bother? Instead, a good prequel should tell the reader why they should care. Dune, as a single book, ironically feels like it had more depth than this book.With one exception. I did like seeing Leto Atreides becoming a leader. I thought making him an aggressive military commander was an interesting choice. The authors, as they did in the previous novels, did make him a bit too much of a goody two-shoes, but I do feel like the explanation for why he became so popular prior to the events of Dune makes sense.Ironically, despite the title, I didn't feel I'd gained much insight into House Corrino at all. Emperor Shaddam comes across as petulant and semi-retarded. This is not the same man who laid such devious plans in Dune and was so careful to hide his involvement in the downfall of House Atreides. Perhaps Shaddam grew wiser within the intervening years, but if so THAT is the story I would have wanted to read. Instead, in this book, we constantly hear Shaddam moaning about how he can make decisions without Fenring's advice (even when it's clear that he can't).Also, this book contradicts Dune in a major way. Paul is born on Kaitin, not Caladan, even though in Dune it's clear he'd never left his home world. Why? Why contradict Frank Herbert's masterpiece? Having Paul born on Kaitin added nothing to the story or his character.As this is the final book, I'm forced to ask myself if I should have read the series at all. I'd give the series as a whole 3 stars. There were some nice backstories, particularly for Gurney Halleck, Leto, and Count Fenring. But the books are just not well written. House Corrino especially feels like a triumph of breadth over depth - exactly the opposite of Frank Herbert's Dune books. I &#34;read&#34; these books as audiobooks while doing other chores, so overall I didn't exactly lose too much of my time with the books. For Dune fans, they'll perhaps give you a spice hit, but they won't inspire you to run out and get the next set of Dune books written by Herbert & Anderson.Overall: 2.5 stars.\", 'A really great read .

KIND OF SHORT, BUT GOOD EXAMPLES.  I LIKE A LOT OF JOE VITALE'S WORK.  THIS IS REALLY ABOUT THE LAW OF RECIPRICATION AND GETTING BACK WHAT YOU GIVE OUT.\", \"I love a good angel book and this was definitely that. Jona gets into a lot of trouble as her mum dumped her in am Orphanage and she never saw her again, that was twelve years ago. Now she tries to survive by nicking and she ends up nicking a jumper and getting arrested. She has to do charity on her aunts vineyard in France but she has never met her aunt and discovers her mum is also going to be living there too. This is how she meets Julian, he's annoying, really gorgeous and keeps her on her toes but she has this attraction to him that she tries to keep under wraps. There are a lot of secrets going on and Jona is determined to find out what is going on especially the secrets involving Julian. I found it very gripping and i love the banter between Julian and Jona and there relationship was really heartfelt and so sweet. It was just a really light, happy, feel good book and i couldn't put it down. There was some sad moments when Jona and her mum have heart to hearts and when you find out that her mum is dying from cancer. Great writing and great author.\", \"I was eager to read a sequel to the highly atmospheric and creepy &#34;The Shining&#34;  however this book was neither.  the characters were bland, the atmosphere was bland and the story was bland.  Sorry to be so succinct but &#34;bland&#34; sums it all up.  there simply was very little punch to it.  It bothers me to give such a review since I have been such an emphatic and long time fan of King's work.  &#34;Doctor Sleep&#34; is worth reading if your a fan and your interested in what comes after &#34;The Shining&#34; but I can't say that you should expect much excitement.  It's not the typical material I have come to expect from King.  Sorry SK!\", 'Concept was good, but lacking execution. Needed intense editing and better grasp with its plot.

I hate you, I love you, oh please make love to me. Sigh!', 'Big disappointment . Most if the items listed were insignificant. There was no room to add very many extra items.', 'If you are looking for a story that has pulse-pounding suspense, a love destined by fate, and a twist you never saw coming, then Chaysing Dreams is your perfect choice. Fate has a funny way of twisting and entwining the chords of our lives. What we carefully plan for our life is sometimes dismantled thread by thread until we are facing that which we have carefully ignored and hidden away. Fate is a cruel master, but a sweet friend. Choose thoughtfully and wisely the path you follow and always trust your instincts.Tess is considered an above average student, a very talented athlete, and a wonderful daughter and friend. While things in her life like school and sports seem to come easy for her, the only problem that she has is a reoccurring nightmare that she just can&#8217;t shake. In her dream she is running away from an unknown evil that is relentlessly pursuing her. She doesn&#8217;t understand what the dream means, but she can never forget the terror that it instills in her heart. As time passes, she comes across another confusing bump in her otherwise perfect life. His name is Chris. She is drawn to him in a way that she can&#8217;t explain, and no matter how hard she tries to get to know him, he continually draws her in only to push her away. Her disappointment simmers until she can take no more, and the explosion that follows will change her world forever.I very much enjoyed discovering the characters with the pages of this book. Each of them brought a special piece to the amazing mosaic that took shape before my eyes. Of all of the characters, Tess really touched me the most. I found her to be a very believable and beautiful character. It&#8217;s very easy to identify with her throughout her journey. She longs to live a full life, and in her mind that means meeting and exceeding all of her goals.  She doesn&#8217;t factor love into her plans, and as a result, her world is turned upside down when love makes its grand entrance and begins to show her what she is missing out on. The chaos that Chris brings with him sends her mind into a wild frenzy, but once she is able to understand and accept her feelings toward him as genuine, she is then free to return his love. What she receives in return will transform her life and shape her into the extraordinary person that she was always meant to be.The pace was a little slow in the beginning, but once it picked up, there was no stopping it. The suspense and mystery that surrounds Chris and Tess will pull you in as you fall under their spell of heartache and strength. You will want to learn all of their secrets, but the truth always comes with danger as these secrets were never meant to see the light of day. I very much enjoyed reading this story, and I look forward to the next book in this trilogy.', \"Ordering this book was a mistake, on a couple of levels.  First,(my bad!) I didn't read the description detail, and thought it was another of his wacky, off-the-wall novels about Florida and it's population of crooks, con-men, sleaze-balls and land developers. (Florida is a lot like Alaska in that sense).  I didn't realize it was a collection of his Miami Herald columns.  I had not been exposed to his columns before, we don't get a lot of copies of the Herald here in Alaska.  However, now that I've read this collection, I realize that instead of being just novelist with a wicked sense of satire, he's another liberal, progressive, environmentalist, anti-gun, Bush-bashing partisan hack that would be perfectly at home on the editorial staff of the NYT.  In one sense, he's like Obama.  He &#34;has a gift&#34;.  Too bad that like Obama, he uses it to advance the progressive agenda.  I won't be buying any more of his books.\", \"Every Lis Wiehl book I've read has been compelling. I feel like I know many of the character personally, I have a hard time putting her books down.

I was on vacation in Europe, and actually looked forward to returning to my room at the B&B; - and my tablet so I could see what Sam was up to next. I love the strength of her relationships with her friends who have become her family over time, and her relationship with her new love.I don't want to give too many details because I don't want to ruin the story for other readers, but I laughed, I cried, and I cried more... But in the end, everything just felt good. I felt that Sam's Story ended exactly like it should!\", \"I bought this book thinking I was getting a book based on fact.  As I read the introduction, I realized that the book wasn't what I thought it was.  It was suggested by an Indian chief that a thousand white women be sent to the Indian tribes to help  them  assimilate into the white culture.  HOWEVER,  the chief was turned down and it never happened.  The book is a work of fiction about  what might have happened if the women had, indeed, been sent.The author was not dishonest about the premise of the book.  It was right at the first of the book.  The teaser I read, however, was very misleading.I haven't read the book yet, so don't take this as a negative rating based on the book.  I did think that the reader should know before he bought just what it was he was buying.\", 'The only thing that kept me reading this book to conclusion was that I was counting the typographical errors.  The story premises, a missing bride on a Caribbean Island had caught my eye.  That it is #6 in a series, makes me wonder how bad the other five could be.  The story was filled with thoroughly unlikeable characters, especially the two main ones Cindy and Mattheus whose personal problems totally overshadowed the story line.  By the time Cindy was in grave danger, I was rooting for the villain just to put me out of my misery.', \"I love reading fantasy/paranormal books.  They are truly a guilty pleasure.  I like that Elise is such a strong character despite all the things she has to put up with.  I must admit I'd like to smack James up side the head for his density regarding dealing with Elise....... he just doesn't seem to get how to make it all right.  Oh well..... Elise soldiers on anyways.  Definitely read this series from the beginning...... in fact, read the whole Descent Series first.  I've spent a couple of weeks enjoying this new world and am really looking forward to the next installment.\", \"Alex Callahan is a journalist forced to use his own investigative skills to track down the man who kidnapped his twin sons. Cue some five-hundred pages of Alex traveling across the country to question various people.&#34;The Murder Artist&#34; started okay, but eventually became a complete chore to finish. The first half goes through all the elements involved in tracking and solving a kidnapping case. Local police, FBI agents, private investigators, media assistance....it all seems accurate, but it's not terribly thrilling. When Alex strikes out on his own, you would think that would kickstart the tension and suspense. But....no. The second half of the novel is Alex chasing various leads and questioning a never-ending supply of people. He will meet up with one person who gives him some information, at which point that person will direct him to another person for him to get some further facts from. It's just endless. And he doesn't even seem like a particularly good investigative journalist. At one point he has a magician right in front of him mentioning a &#34;rope trick&#34;, and never actually follows this up. Instead, he ends the interview and starts visiting bookstores to learn more. Huh?There's just a long line of delaying tactics employed to drag out the word count. The worst offender is the voodoo ritual Alex participates in to apparently learn some more information about the kidnapper. Only to not learn much at all, and advised to question yet more people. And if the detective on the case has all these ideas about what leads Alex should follow and who he should question - WHY ISN'T THE DETECTIVE DOING THIS HIMSELF?Perhaps the most grating element of all is the fact that this had the potential to be really creepy and exciting. A magician who has gone off the rails to employ murder as part of his act? Sounds great! There are also brief shining moments when the killer taunts Alex by leaving clues, or leading him on a creepy goose-chase through a cemetery. But it doesn't add up to much. The author is too busy having Alex question people to pay any attention to other elements, such as....WHY THE KIDNAPPER IS DOING THIS? I would have appreciated some more insight into the kidnapper's mindset.Also got annoyed at the portrayal of the twins' mother. She gives up hope very quickly, hassles Alex about spousal support payments, and is not heard from again. Didn't ring true for a second, and the &#34;uncaring mother&#34; is a cliche I would like to see less of in kidnapping-themed thrillers (particularly considering a woman is one of the co-writers).I forced myself to finish this. It was boring, unsuspenseful, and unbelievable.\", \"You never know what you're going to get when you pick up a science fiction novel from an unknown author that you've never read  (or even heard of) before.  This book showed up on my recomended list from Amazon.  I read the brief write up and it sounded like something that I would enjoy. So I took the chance and purchased it.The books starts out well enough.  It's first half is very reminicent of some of the Steve Alten &#34;Meg&#34; novels.  Basically while searching for oil, scientists discover a hidden cave system three miles under the Earths surface. In that cave system lies an acient sea that has been completely separated and protected from the outside world.  And in this secret sea, we find another secret.....Predator X.The main character of the book is Megan.  The story is told from her perspective.  She is some sort of geologist and when the first team of explorers to the hidden sea turns up missing she jumps at the chance to join the rescue team.This book is great for two reasons.  First, Megan's character is so believable - both in her actions and in her dialog - that the story reads like a first person account of something that actually happened.  It gives the story a very &#34;real&#34; feel to it.  Second, about halfway through the book, the plot thickens......and then thickens some more.....and then more again.  What starts off as an unsuspecting fish story, blows up into a full-on science fiction romp.  By the time you get to the end of the book, you've completely given up on trying to guess what's happening next.  The ending is refreshing because it's not where you expect Waller to go with it.My only slight knock on the book is its title.  The story is so much larger than the surviving Pliosaur at the bottom of the prehistoric sea.  Maybe that was intentional on Waller's part so as not to give away the major plot twists hidden later in the book....but I can't help but feel that there is a better title out there for this one.  Regardless, this book is fun and absolutely worth the read for anyone who enjoys a good science fiction story.  I will absolutely read C.J. Waller again.  Very nicely done.\", \"First of all, this book needs some serious editing.  This book probably should not have been sold in it's  current version.  The story itself is a little unbelievable.  Billionaire brothers who beat up their fathers don't exist in most people's lives.  The storyline or what I could make out to be the storyline is really weak.

Salvatore summarises the more impressive and epic exploits of Drizzt and King Bruenor. Sadly, everything else is slapdash and haphazard.Not only are all characters beyond Dahlia given a cursory introduction and background at best, but the padding is blatantly obvious and excessive. Nothing is interesting, and the combat is needlessly long-winded, wordy and dull. It's as if Salvatore needed to reach a pre-specified word count rather than tell a gripping story. Most of the villains (who, presumably, will have their plotlines and motives fleshed out and concluded in the latter books of the Neverwinter saga) are cookie-cutter, self-obsessed and motivated by power and/or revenge. When half-demon tieflings have no qualms about slaughtering their own brethren, you know the author has given up on coming up with original or even complex and well-rounded ideas.The ending is so derivative and dull that it's not worth dignifying through criticism.\", 'This book is not relevant to modern life.

Spoiler alert -- could he really have advanced so far in the police force without someone getting wise to him?  If so, pretty heavy condemnation of the police establishment.

And it also doesn't matter since it almost never works anymore because it was such a popular method and easy to exploit (My opinion only).Ok so that was the first few chapters.Then they go into some proprietary oscillators which they don't explain what they really are they just call them L1, L2, L3, L4 and what you should do when the lines reach a point or cross or whatever.

Hurry Annica Rossi!\", \"After Layla and Seth end up 'accidentally' engaged, Layla wants to keep the engagement to help her land an important client.  Seth has always wanted to somehow let Layla knows that he's been in love with her for years.This is a fun to read novella that keeps your interest even though you may guess how the story will end.  The characters are easy to like and well-written.  I loved Seth as being a man willing to take risks for and with Layla.  Although I was bit miffed that she was only willing to keep up the facade for her career, she was upfront with Seth.  The descriptions of the house and decorations made me wish that I could spend Christmas there.This is the first in a 'Year of Weddings' novellas, although the titles can be read in any order.  I am looking forward to reading the rest of the series.Note:  I recieved a copy for a fair and honest review.\", \"So you finally find the man for u,now all of a sudden you're an  expert on the subject?I could'nt even take this book seriously.\", \"There are so many good things about this book, it's hard to list them all.Lets start with the general premise without spoilers:If you've read The Companions, you know that Catti-Brie, Regis, Wulfgar, and Bruenor are alive again and re-united with Drizzt. Their mission (as was hinted before) is to put Thibbledorf Pwent, now a vampire residing in Gauntylgrym, to rest. But that will be complicated because House Xolarrin has taken over Gauntlygrym, remember? This book has a ton of battles and action involving the companions, which is quite satisfying and is the main part of the book, as well as my favorite part. However, it switches off between this and drow characters. There is a lot of intrigue with characters like Quenthel Baenre, Jarlaxle, and Gromph, to name a few. Drizzt's &#34;friends&#34; from the Neverwinter series (Entreri, Dhalia, Afafrenfere, Ambergris, and Effron) are in the novel as well, and some important stuff goes on with them, too.As for the quality of the book:The battles are tense, exciting, and action packed all the way to the end. It's wonderful to see the companions of the hall back together again, and this time around in their second lives I find that they are much more interesting. Regis is the most transformed character, because now he is brave and capable of fighting alongside the others, and is quite useful as well. This is a refreshing thing to see. Catti-Brie is now a cleric/mage and a chosen of Mielikki, which also spices things up a bit since before every member was more or less a fighter. Wulfgar and Bruenor are not as drastically changed, which some readers have complained about. I think it is fine, since there is no need to fix what isn't broken. All in all, everything evens out pretty well.Now for the other half of the book (the drow intrigue). I enjoyed it very much and found it very interesting. If you like the drow, you will not be disappointed. We get to see what is going on in Menzoberranzan, what the houses are doing, who is plotting with who, so on and so forth. If have been recently confused in the Drizzt saga, prepare to become more confused. The book will tease you all the way to the end, hinting at this or that, and never revealing too much. Then right near the end, there are some massive plot twists that will reveal everything. You will get the answers you desperately need. After reading it, you will have a pretty good idea about what the drow are planning and what the general path of the next books will be. This makes for a very gripping read that will have you absorbed right up to the end. And when you finish, you will be satisfied, but awaiting the next Drizzt book VERY eagerly. (It is somewhat of a cliffhanger ending.)To summarize:This book is exciting, tense, stressful at times, interesting, and action-packed. It has something of everything, so that no matter what your favorite aspect of Salvatore's books is, there will be something for you. This novel is a recovery from the terrible mess that was the Neverwinter series. It will renew your faith in Salvatore. For all the disappointed fans, myself included, THIS BOOK IS FOR YOU.\", \"Lucy was a wonderful mother she deserved to be happy.I'm was glad that she met Evan..They went through a lot before they were together.Evan is a good man.I'm happy they found each other to give to each other that they gave to others.Thank you Ruby Miller\", 'I really liked another serie by this author but I could not get into this book, too dark and sinister for my taste. did not even finish reading it.', 'This is a dreadful book.

I have always been fascinated by Mary of Bethany and her faith and this is what drew me to this title. I appreciate the authors effort but this was just not what I expected. It was not entirely bad. It just had much more added that had nothing much to do with the topic specifically of Mary of Bethany and her mystery. Yet again, there is not much written about her in Scripture so I should have realized this before picking the book up.The author explores all the Scripture where Mary of Bethany is mentioned. There is then a lot of information that may or may not relate to those texts specifically. There was one specific section that discussed prayer and was critical of some other Christian authors that I was uncomfortable with. Yet then later there was a big emphasis on grace and the cross. I just got mixed messages and really tried to like this title but it fell short. I hate writing any review that is bad or discouraging so this is the best I can do for this title.Again, it was a brave undertaking for an entire book.', \"I gave this book two stars because the characters and the plot were not fully developed.

But there was something disturbingly different about Alice and her adventures with food that had odd effects, and what she saw and did after her fall into the rabbit hole.  That was one of the many books that were parodied in this story, and it also made me uncomfortable, like I was watching someone's bad trip with hallucinatic drugs.I pushed myself to read the entire book, just to see if there are hidden gems or laughs that made this entertainment.  But the further I read, the stranger it got, and by the end, I just wanted to escape from this book.  It was quirky, and even a bit humorous to start, but started down a darker path, and just became 'out of control'.

A tale of eccentric characters on a real life tramp freighter voyage when Buckley was a much younger man, It's a fascinating read for a landlubber like me and very well done. Not once does Buckley refer to himself (he does recount his feelings in an essay republished in Wry Martinis).

It is supposedly about teenage love (17 year olds) yet this book left me wondering if I lost my mind - especially given most people gave it 5 stars...I need to explain why I am baffled and concerned: The language/dialogue used in this book reads like an over-the-top soap opera x10 spoken by 65 year olds with a lot of life experience...The inner dialogues go on for pages, while at times, even the dialogues themselves are made up of 20 sentences to answer a simple question like &#34;How are you?&#34;  I was once 17 and have a 16 year old myself.  There is no way in hell any kids (because that's what you are at that age) today would ever use the kind of expressions these kids do in this book.  The heroine is a spoiled girl who, without reason, decides that she will never marry or have kids because she is too focused on having her dream career:  a professional cheerleader!  wow!  At 17 years old, she had never been kissed etc, nor has she EVER cared about boys.  Yeah right! Then she meets our hero, and within two days she's like &#34;I need to have sex with you!&#34; and oh my, he is delicious, sexy, hot....but, only to use him as her first.  Downhill for me.  This chick is a robot with an all-of-a-sudden sex drive!  BUT, she is still determined never to care, love, etc...Then we get to our hero, who apparently, is a manwhore (who doesn't kiss his hookups, because, well that's too intimate!

He falls head over heels, but also doesn't ever want to get married or be tied down, yet, within two weeks he is ready to spend his life with her - and if she still doesn't want him - he will spend the rest of his life alone with his hand...Riiiiight!  Some of the things (and there are too many) are so over the top, one really sits and scratches one's head and thinks &#34;What the heck made me read this crap?&#34;  I'm rarely this disappointed in a book, but this one was one of them.

I really have no idea how to explain this world because the authors fail to give a clear context to it. Think snow and cold temperatures, think bombs going off for really no good clear reason, think individuals with special abilities who are outcasts. It&#8217;s a lot easier to think of these things when given an explanation for them, but it&#8217;s all very murky and messy.Helping Nat traverse across the snowy wasteland is Wes, a former Marine Sergeant and seasoned mercenary. All this I am supposed to believe despite his age and personality&#8230;if I can even say he has one. A little sample of Nat&#8217;s love interest&#8217;s thoughts:&#8220;She seemed like a cool chick.&#8221;I almost stopped reading after this line and in retrospect, I probably should have done just that. Both Nat and Wes are inexplicably occupied with each other at the most inconvenient of times and their whole relationship feels contrived and shallow.Strange jumps and quick transitions are used to hurry the story along, but details are glazed over. This neglect is the reason the authors fail to bring this world to life. The action is too abrupt, both in origin and conclusion. As a result whenever another bomb explodes or another confrontation happens, you&#8217;re left wondering what the point was. A lot happens in this book and it has no real purpose but to make this world seem more exciting or more dangerous, but it fails to do either.', 'I LOVED this story and the ending.

I've been waiting for her to release something new, and I was ecstatic to find out Concealed is a romantic-suspense/thriller, which is one of my favorite genres.  Concealed absolutely gripped me!  I was pulled in immediately in the prologue, and my heart kept racing until the very end!I love how the romance in Concealed is slow, simmering, and butterfly-producing.  Sydney finds herself smitten with the small town of Elton with its handsome sheriff smitten with her!  The connection between Sydney and Wade is written with charm and ease. Just thinking of their first kiss makes me all giddy!  I love it when an author makes me feel that way, don't you?Concealed has everything that I want in a mystery thriller.  There's a good reason why Sydney has been on the run, and the suspense kept my rapt attention page after page.  The characters are all so likeable and well developed.  The people Sydney works with are sincere and fun. Her neighbor is just full of awesome.  Sydney's daughter is the cutest little thing. I ended up caring about them all!  Plus, the pacing of the story is perfect and there were twists that I didn't see coming...goodness!If you're looking for a nail-biting, romantic thriller, I highly recommend Concealed.

There was also too much narration about things that didn't matter. More about Sasha's background, making her somewhere I could give a damn about would have been helpful.The hero was flat.

It is very, very rare for me to not finish a book and this was coming close to being the first book in four years that I did not finish.I think what kind of bothered me is that it seems like a ripoff of one of my favorite TV shows.

First, it seems a natural follow up to the 60s bookThe Structure of Scientific Revolutions: 50th Anniversary Editionwhich Harry Collins refers to - along with a chain of previous thinkers to Wittgenstein who certainly seems to have set the language game paradigm with all of the associated issues. The reason it is important is because it helps define the various types of expertise as still further language games wherein certain kinds of vocabularies and axioms are part of the game. RememberPhilosophical Investigations, the nature of the certainty is the type of the language game. Harry Collins describes a vocabulary and language game that is necessary to organize the types of scientific expertise - so in a sense is a meta language about such languages. Since disputes in public media over scientific positions that are subject not only to expert debate but also democratic non-expert decision making processes, several interesting examples of which Harry Collins describes to make his points, this vocabulary ought to become part of our ubiquitous meta-expertise. Second, using the three wave model to describe the way science was viewed after WWII and scientists were the new priesthood, then science lost its divine position (and it seemed like everyone was equally a scientific expert) and Thomas Kuhn seemed to speak for this wave, and now we need a third wave where we recognize that scientists are people too but not everyone can speak as an expert unless they have reached a level of interactional expertise where few with tacit knowledge and 10,000 hours of practiceOutliers: The Story of Successof practice go. Also notice sheepherders are experts at sheepherding and not one of \"us.\" One critique I have is that practically everywhere Harry Collins refers to us as having each our own expertise in our jobs and our ubiquitous expertise - so that we can catch a liar in the act, so to speak. But I suspect for as much as a fourth of the population mental disabilities of one sort or another make this a false assumption. They certainly wouldn\\'t be reading the book, but many of them vote! It is also interesting to me to think applying the various kinds of expertise with regard to other areas outside of gravitational waves, global weather, and vaccinations. Such academic areas as theology, religions, psychology, and many others. Harry Collins does not offer to extend his analyses in these other directions but consider the usefulness in doing that. I am thinking of Charles Taylor\\'s idea inA Secular Ageregarding \"thin\" religions versus thick ones. How many people falsely think they are experts at religion for example?', 'I barey made it to the second page of the second chapter before having had my fill of the name dropping and mentions of deisgner this and antique furniture that.  I will not even attemp another by this author.', \"One of my favorite things about this book is that it's actually set during the school year. So many YA novels are summertime-themed (*cough*guilty*cough*) so it's refreshing to see one that actually deals with school, classes, and other aspects of a teenager's life. The MC, Wren, sets out on a mission to win the lead role in the school play, with nerves and ambitions like any other teenage girl, but on the side, her real passion is interior design/decorating. One of the coolest things about Wren is her liking for/talent in woodshop class. It's so opposite of everything girly, but it works for her, and it really plays into the depth of her character.Wren it put to the test after her aunt, the school's play director, quits - and she has to take over the school play. I don't want to spoil the book, but I loved the interactions between Wren and Derek. Their dynamic - within the realm of the play and outside of it - was great, and I loved how she tried to place her own feelings about him rather than assuming his reputation was legit. They weren't without conflict, but the ending of this book was incredibly sweet. If I had to find a word to describe this book, I'd go with &#34;cute&#34; because it's just adorable and fun and everything that contemporary YA novels should be. Wren's personal growth and accomplishments over the course of the novel along with well-rounded characters makes this a great read for YA fans of all ages!\", \"As others have implied here, this book is profoundly wrong in countless ways, but most importantly from its basic premise of preaching moral relativism. As reviewers have noted, one could use the same arguments and narrative that this author uses to completely rationalize away the horrors of Hitler. The author uses standard rhetorical techniques to deflect and turn our eyes away from the situation of women in Islam, a religion that is fundamentally paternalistic and that requires women to be subservient to men. It's really hard to believe that this author is a professor at Columbia University, and that this passes for scholarship. Everything is relative, I guess...\", 'Not for me. This story combines a great idea/thought experiment (the investigation into the murder of a post-ice age man) with bad science and the worst of the new age ideas of a matriarchal culture.

Like so many others I came to this book after Ender's Game (which I found to be a true masterpiece) and was so let down by what I found. I read the whole book hoping for it to get better, for some of the genius in Ender's Game to come through, but the story never did.First of all, this book isn't a sermon about Catholicism, it actually bashes it. A lot of it seemed to me like the author was thumbing his nose at Catholic beliefs and trying to glorify his own religion in the book. (No, I'm not Catholic) Funny how people see &#34;Catholic&#34; a few times on a page and suddenly they react like someone is trying to convert them.Anywho, there are parts of the book that work. The aliens weren't really a problem for me.  It was interesting-ish albeit slow. (Spoilers follow)  My main issue was with the characterization  of so many characters in this book. Ender has changed into this overly feeling guy. It's like the other extreme of what he was in the first book. I haven't read Ender in Exile yet, maybe that's why it's too sudden of a shift for meI was actually laughing at parts near the end where the author forces Ender and Novina together. It was like a bad soap opera or something. After knowing of the existence of a man for four days, of which you sorta spoke like two times in (both of which were quite hostile), suddenly you're all lovely dovey with him? I mean, wth? And with Ender- you see a picture of a young girl and you instantly fall in love with her and want to raise her babies as your own? And the children after having such a crappy father, after a 15 min conversation with Ender suddenly they see that he is the exact father they have always wanted? It's all just so rushed. People who have been in the situations those kids and that woman have been through need wayyy more time than that before they can learn to trust. Granted kids are prone to trust more easily than adults. It'd be a more normal reaction for them to think, &#34;he speaks the truth but he may being doing it to get something from me.&#34; Rather than living in some fairy land where all your magical dreams can come true. Too much, too soon. This book heavily needed to work on relationship growth. It's too much like a story you'd tell your kids where they all fall in love at first sight and live happily ever after. Maybe I'm a cynic, but I've never seen anything close to that in real life, which makes it lame to come across in a book for grown upsAlso, this book seemed like it needed an editor to cut down on the wordiness. Too wordy and too boring because of itSide note, those long ass names were annoying. They didn't even have much to do with the nicknames they had for most of them. It's like, why write them in?\", \"I bought this book for my kids. When I read it to my kids, they enjoyed it and told me to share it with other parents.

And the main reason is : a 17 year old has sex with a teacher and nothing bad happens.  Other issues are a whole race of people subjugated and enslaved for the pleasure and protection of another &#34;higher race&#34;. Repeated scenes of underage drug use and drinking, young girls being inpregnated and it being taken as normal. And a vampire princess destined to rule them through a &#34;democratic monarchy&#34; ( I mistrust any system that states it has an absolute ruler that is elected). There were moments of interest and the world itself has depth, and the characters were tolerable. but I just could not get beyond there being no consequences to the idiotic behavior of almost every character in the books.If Ms. Mead had just set her stories in College, most of my issues go away.  It still would be an uneven story with serious character issues, but if everyone is an adult, then it is just stupid behavior not criminal.  There are better teen romances out there.  There are better vampire novels out there (and no twilight is not one of them, a 100 year old stalker man in love with a teenager is not ok just because he looks young.).

I'm reading all in his Longmire series which leaves me down to the remaining short stories and if you read the series and enjoy them, this one will not disappoint you either.  I don't normally choose to read short stories as I don't want to get involved for merely a short while but Johnson's &#34;Steamboat&#34; is a little longer than short and his characters and situations are too well-written not to include &#34;Steamboat&#34; in your must reads.  As usual, Walt Longmire's character is amusing and humorous, unlike his television counterpart which is portrayed as a more serious sort.  I like them both!\", 'A real yawn fest.

But then her younger sister Nicole joins the clique.  And then Nicole gets killed.  And Toni and Ryan are convicted of murder.This book gets off to a painfully slow start, to the point where I don&#8217;t know that &#8220;tedious&#8221; really does it justice.  Lots of time is spent on depictions of a Toni as an unruly teenage girl.  Sex, drugs, and alcohol become repetitive to the point where it&#8217;s unclear whether the author is making a point, or advocating them.  Emotions and feelings are described for pages and pages while nothing is really happening.  Granted, you need to spend some time setting up the background, and establishing characters&#8217; motives and frame of mind, but you could easily skip the first half of the book and not miss much.Toni is well fleshed-out as whiny, obnoxious, and totally unsympathetic; traits not normally satisfying in a lead character outside of a tale of redemption.  Her boyfriend, Ryan, has a bad reputation but aside from getting stoned a lot he&#8217;s repeatedly shown to have the proverbial heart of gold.  The rest of the cast are mostly stereotypes plucked from your choice of rebellious teen movies.The action appears in fits and starts, although things start to get interesting near the end.  When you finally find out who-dunnit though, it&#8217;s pretty unbelievable.This may succeed as women&#8217;s literature, but it&#8217;s advertised as a &#8220;Blockbuster Thriller&#8221;, and in that genre it&#8217;s a total failure.

There they meet the companion ships of the one wrecked on the moon, and their occupants. A fleet of ships traveled from a distant solar system to protect Earth from an alien threat. A threat that will arrive in exactly 268 years. This statement gets repeated over and over. I&#8217;m not sure what bothers me, the fact that the date when the alien threat will discover Earth is so exact, or that this warning is flashed to the reader every other page. The reader quickly becomes desensitized of any reaction to the threat.Another disconcerting aspect is the character's interests. One is obsessed with weapons, so every other thought he has is about the possibility of seeing the ship's weapons. This guy only thinks about how much he misses his sister (or wife and kid, I can't keep it straight) and how much he wants to get his hands on alien weapons. That's it. He doesn't get hungry or tired, doesn't get frustrated with anything, just thinks about his sister and weapons. And how much he knows his friend wants to get back to his wife and kid.

That is, people who think that if a movie or a book is not saturated with action, it is not worth their time. So, even when the story does not require an action sequence, Rollins inserts one. For discerning readers, the result is poisonous, agonizing pulp.Not only is the action excessive, much of it is implausible. The early boat chase on the Yangtze River? Not only can it be deleted without affecting the story, the end of the chase is silly. It is inappropriate for a serious novel, though fine for a comic book. Later on Rollins inserts a sequence reminiscent of John Wayne\\'s prominent Rooster Cogburn sequence in TRUE GRIT. The difference is that Rooster Cogburn\\'s is more realistic.

I admit that I haven't followed the Fantastic Four very closely for the past few years. I know that Jonathan Hickman made quite a few changes to the general cast of characters when he was writing the book, but I had no idea the book was largely dominated by children, now. And where are the original cast members? What is going on? Sure, I like She-Hulk, but not really in a team book. And the rest of these characters are D-listers, as best. I certainly don't pick up a book like Fantastic Four to read about adventures of children and their reading-glasses-wearing purple dragon nanny. Why are there mole men in the Baxter building? Why is one of them a decapitated head? Why is one a cross-dresser? Aren't mole men asexually grown clones to begin with? And who is this old Johnny Storm character with the burned face and gaping eye socket where his eye should be? Not only was I completely lost while reading this, the stories were not engaging and even off-putting. The book is full of character I know little about, care even less about, and it's illustrated by one of my least-favorite illustrators - Mike Allred. All-in-all, I really couldn't find a single thing I enjoyed about this book. I really couldn't even make it through to the end. I made it about 75%of the way through the book, but even that was a chore. This is the worst thing I've read from Marvel in a few years, and I strongly recommend that you steer clear of this train wreck.

Buried in this serviceable rendering is a fascinating story of either one women's break with reality or a police and prosecution miscarriage of justice.  However, because the author essentially recites the daily happenings of the courthouse and trial, we don't ever get a feel for the account buried beneath the synapse of the court proceeding or police report.  Had this author taken the risk of taking a position or staked a claim regarding abuse by the prosecution, this book would have been a groundbreaking work.  Instead it is merely a recounting, though a gripping one.The Author's Note at the conclusion details how the author believed that Darlie's defense team had established reasonable doubt.  From the reader's perspective the observation comes as a surprise.  The 313 pages seem centered more on the prosecution's presentation of the crime and the alleged killer instead of the story that the censored courtroom drama misses.  It takes a special author to investigate and write such a book and such works usually take years to perfect.  Most true crime publisher's don't have that kind of patience but the potential is here for what could have been a balanced, definitive account of both the defense and the prosecution and the story behind the trial and that's why I can't give it five stars.  If you are looking for a good recap of the arrest and trial though, I can definitely recommend it.\", \"One example: look at how Gordis treats the Deir Yassin massacre (see p. 75). He says accounts of the massacre are &#8220;hotly contested.&#8221; In other words, the truth cannot be ascertained. Gordis whitewashes the massacre, a war crime atrocity which is one chapter in the Israeli holocaust of the Palestinians. This type of holocaust denial will not land the denier in jail. There is not even a plaque marking the site of the Deir Yassin massacre. Never forget? When it comes to Israeli slaughters of Palestinians it is incumbent on us to forget in order to qualify as morally respectable in western eyes.Early in the morning of April 9, 1948, commandos of the Irgun, among whom was Mr. Gordis&#8217; hero Menachem Begin, and members of the Stern Gang, attacked Deir Yassin, an Arab village. It was several weeks before the end of the British Mandate and the declaration of the State of Israel. The village lay outside the area to be assigned by the United Nations to the Jewish state; it had a peaceful reputation; it was even said by a Jewish newspaper to have driven out some Arab militants. But it was located on high ground in the corridor between Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, and with the knowledge of the mainstream Jewish defense force, the Haganah, it was to be conquered and held.In spite of being better armed, the two Zionist terror gangs were at first unable to conquer the village. But after they elicited the help of a small band of Palmach troops (the elite fighters of the Haganah), Deir Yassin soon fell. The Palmach soldiers left; it was then that the massacre began. That evening over tea and cookies, in the neighboring Zionist settlement of Givat Shaul, the Jewish terrorist told foreign correspondents that over 200 Arabs were killed and forty taken prisoner. This was reported in the New York Times the very next day (April 10, 1948, p. 6).The Judaic terrorists claimed to have lost four of their own. They boasted of the &#34;battle&#34; but made no mention of the male Palestinians whom they had loaded onto trucks, paraded through some Jewish sections of Jerusalem, and then taken back to a stone quarry between Givat Shaul and Deir Yassin and shot to death. On April 13, 1948 the New York Times reported that 254 Arab men, women, and children had been killed at Deir Yassin; there was no mention of prisoners.The official Zionist leaders of the Haganah denounced the dissidents of the Irgun and the Stern Gang accusing them of massacre, robbery, looting and barbarism. Ben Gurion even sent an apology to King Abdullah. But this horrific act served the future state of Israel well. As Begin said, &#34;Arabs throughout the country, induced to believe wild tales of 'Irgun butchery' were seized with limitless panic and started to flee for their lives. This mass flight soon developed into a maddened, uncontrollable stampede. The political and economic significance of this development can hardly be over estimated.&#8221; (Begin, &#34;The Revolt,&#34; p.164)  While modern historians argue that Begin's claims were exaggerated and that the actual number of Arabs killed was closer to 100, they all agree that the massacre at Deir Yassin marked the beginning of the depopulation of over 400 Arab villages and the exile of over 700,000 Palestinians.In spite of protests by Martin Buber, Albert Einstein and other noted scholars, within a year the village was repopulated with orthodox Judaic immigrants from Poland, Rumania and Slovakia. Its Palestinian cemetery was bulldozed and its name was wiped off the map. It is today completely obliterated. The massacre site is a few hundred yards from the Yad Vashem Holocaust Museum dedicated to victims of the Nazis. Yad Vashem makes no mention of the massacre of Arabs by the Judaic Nazis among whom we number Menachem Begin. Gordis has written a whitewash of a mass murderer.

Not only did the synopsis pull me in from the start but I also found out that this was Angie McKeon&#8217;s debut novel.

WOW, WOW, WOW. I read this book in one sitting. No freaking way was I going to go to bed and NOT know what happened to Cooper, Kylie, and of course the handsome Gray.At 3% (got to love the Kindle) into the book my heart was already in my throat. I was sending personal messages to my book friends asking for support. I had to take some emotional breaks from reading because I just wasn&#8217;t sure I could handle anymore. I needed to give my heart a break from the story that is Cooper and Kylie. I needed a break from the constant heartbreak that Cooper and Kylie were causing each other. I never once hated Kylie for what she was doing&#8230;I GOT IT. I 100% got it. Maybe because like her, I require love to be given to me the same way from my spouse, and if I wasn&#8217;t receiving it how empty it would make me feel. Would it make me so empty that I would ask my husband for the same thing? Every single one of Kylie&#8217;s actions was just her begging for attention, for love, for anything from Cooper and I get it, I get her, and her actions made her real in every part of the book.Angie McKeon weaved together a story about love and heartbreak that was so real. This story is about the vulnerability that each of us put ourselves in when we love someone. How we give the person we love so much of ourselves that it care tear us apart or push us to be the best person we could ever be. Love makes us do things we would never really do, love can make us whole, or it can make you feel empty. Love is scary as s***. And Angie McKeon did a great job really creating a story that takes us on a journey of love&#8230;and I mean real honest to God love&#8230;not a rainbow and butterfly type of love.One thing that made this story really tie together nicely was how Angie gave us short flashbacks into times in Kylie and Cooper&#8217;s life. Some of these flashbacks were happy some were sad. Either way they really helped develop the overall story.I&#8217;m going to say that this isn&#8217;t a love triangle. I know some would disagree but if you think this is a love triangle book than you&#8217;re wrong. Sorry, I&#8217;m not sorry. There is no triangle. Kylie is fully devoted to one person&#8230;it&#8217;s clear as day in every page that Angie writes. Does this book have cheating&#8230;.hmmmm, yes, but no&#8230;what do you consider cheating?

With the wedding just around the corner, the two of them decide to make a bet, the bet is for the HOUSE! Who wins, for that answer you will just have to read the book. But, the story is good for many reasons one being that Willa and Knox, are like two pieces of a puzzle, they fit together perfectly. Where Willa is not strong, Knox is. And, vice versa for Knox. I felt that their could have been a bit more of their history told to give us a better look into each of the character's, but at the same time, it was great watching their story unfold with each page read.

I understand that this is a series and it's going to answer each question like where is Allie and is she going to come back, and where and what is going on with Greta (Josh's sister) in each of their own stories I just thought we could have got a bit of a wrap up. I would have liked more of a conclusion between Devon and her dad and also with Josh. It kind of just ended with her revelation and didn't show the future or anything which I really enjoy a the end of the books I read. This book just ended very abruptly for me and unfortunately that negatively affected my overall outlook on the book.I don't think I will read Allie's story because I already don't really like her. I mean okay she ran off on her wedding day and that's a dick move to someone you claim to care about but I was more upset with the fact that she dated her best friends ex-boyfriend. She was fully aware how those two felt about each other but she decided to date him and then get married to him in less than a year and asked Devon to be at the wedding. All of those things are just not okay in my book. Especially when she clearly wasn't in love with Josh, I think that makes it all the more worse.So unfortunately for me my questions will remain unanswered when it comes to this series.\", 'Humor and history collide and this book was a lot of fun.

Where have I been that this is my first ever Maya Banks read?  I know, I joined the party was late but I am happy that I finally joined because if this is what I get to read from her than I am a happy reader.Letting Go is a story of learning to let go and move forward.  A story of saying goodbye to one love and open yourself up in hopes of having another love.  For Joss that is exactly what she is forced to do after 3 years of mourning the death of her husband Carson.  Joss is determined to get her life back and be happy again.  Knowing that she will never love someone the way she loves Carson, she is okay with that.  She knows perfection can&#8217;t happen twice in a lifetime but she is tired of being lonely and sad.  She wants to feel again and smile again she doesn&#8217;t want to hurt anymore.  Always knowing that she has kept a part of herself hidden from her husband is bound and determined to explore her hidden desires.  Joss craves dominance and for the first time in her life she is ready to explore that side of her sexuality and will give it all she has.Dash Corbin has loved one girl as long as he can remember.  Always hiding his feelings because well let&#8217;s face it; it would look bad to make the moves on his best friend wife.  Every since the death of his best friend three years old he has waited for the right moment to make his move and let his feelings for Joss be known in hopes of her seeing him in a different light.  Being her strength and shoulder to cry on since the day Carson was killed he has waited until the right time, not really knowing if there was such a thing.  Dash is willing to place a part of him behind him if that means winning the love and trust of Joss.  His needs and desires that sometimes consumes him he is willing to give up for her.  He is willing to do anything, give her anything to prove that he can love her forever.When Dash and Joss come face to face in a setting that neither expect their relationship takes a sudden turn from grieving friends to something that Dash never imagined he could have.  Joss, someone who craves dominance, and Dash someone who craves submission from a woman find themselves seeing each other in a brand new light.  Can they build a dominate/submissive relationship that goes beyond just that and include love?  Or will the ghost of Joss&#8217; husband and Dash&#8217;s best friend Carson haunt them forever?Maya Banks gave me something I needed.  I was intrigued from the very beginning wanting so badly for Joss to move forward with her life and be happy and wanting to see exactly what Dash was willing to give up for Joss.  It was a beautiful story of letting go and finding new love.  There were ups and downs that left me fuming and then there were moments that made my heart swell with love for those 2 characters.  I was connected with the characters from the very start wanting so badly for them to find their happy and hopefully find it with each other.  The sweet moments were as sweet as honey and hot moments were as hot as fire and Maya left me wanting more.Letting Go is Book 1 in the Breathless Trilogy.  I need book 2 like it was yesterday &#8211; May 2014 cannot come quick enough because knowing that Book 2 is about Kylie, Carson&#8217;s sister, and Jensen, Dash&#8217;s new business partner, I can only imagine those 2 characters coming together for their own book that will most definitely be a roller coaster ride I won&#8217;t want to get off of.', \"Once again there's yet another series that Gena Showalter has sucked me into, and once again it's a genre that I don't typically read or get into.

Granted there are other series out there but this one deserves more than just a look see.... While most concentrate on regular everyday people or retired soldiers or even ex Spec Ops, this one actually takes us to the heart of war. In this case in Afghanistan where a small group of soldiers on patrol find themselves cut off from their FOB Bremmel, they've lost more than half of their group and are on the run from an enemy they have no intel on. They make a run for Hairatan hoping to find answers and more importantly a safe place to get away from the large groups of 'Crazies' that have already decimated their group. Unfortunately Hairatan is also under siege and burning. When they finally find a way into the city and a warehouse where they take refuge they are contacted by a couple Seals who fill them in on what is going on. Completely cut off from the world they soon discover that in order to stay alive and possibly find a way back to the states they must now work with the Taliban to fight a common enemy far more dangerous than either could imagine. Its a non stop action packed story of survival and the beginning of a great new series.\", \"When it comes to fast moving, highly enjoyable monster fiction there are few writers who can match William Meikle. He has an extraordinary talent for storytelling and writes so well that his words don't get in the way (and I consider that to be something of a rare ability shared by the best writers). The Creeping Kelp is another tale that hits the ground running and never lets up. Someone should make a film of this, it has that vividness, that feel of a big, special effects laden, thrilling cinema experience.

After the first 9 chapters which were slow paced and ornate with excess detail, I scanned reviews to see how others had evaluated this book. I was not surprised that so many gave up and did not finish. I did complete this book but it never did gain any pace or spark. It took me 3-4 times longer to read this book than usual. Every page was a chore.I did not know this author's work prior to this book. The story is filled with missed opportunities. Lilith, the main character, could have been interesting but was not. The love story seemed without dimension and flat. None of the necromancing drama had impact on me as a reader. Perhaps I was so bludgeoned by descriptions of gowns and hair pins I could no longer care.For me this book did not work as a romance,  mystery or paranormal fiction. My take away is that sometimes a blurb is more interesting than the book itself. I can't recommend this book in any way.\", 'This book is such a naughty good read.. Panty soaker good, the storyline was extremely steamy. I wish I could meet Mr. Goodness!', \"First I should say that I admire anyone who has the guts to write & publish a book That said, those same people should learn basic rules of grammar & punctuation before they publish. That's why there are editors & proofreaders. Ms. Belle really can't figure out when to use a comma; there are well over 50 instances of misused commas, mostly inserting them where they don't belong, but also omitting them where they should be, or using them where a semicolon should be. Apostrophes & hyphens also seem to be challenging for her. Perhaps she should check out Grammarly's online services before publishing her next book.  There are times where the syntax is odd, making it difficult to determine what is being said. Also, it's Marine Corps (not Corp), whose (not who's), one's teeth clench (they don't clinch), the past tense of drag is dragged (not drug). My favorite was when sheik was used when she meant chic. That error made me laugh out loud. I could go on & on, but it's too painful.But, even with all the errors mentioned above, the worst part is the writing -- it's just awful & amateurish. I wish I had paid better attention to the reviews before I wasted my time on this drivel. The mere mention of a comparison to 50 Shades of Gray, possibly the worst book I ever tried to read (but couldn't get past 40 or 50 pages), should have warned me. I skipped the gratuitous S&M; scenes & skimmed much of the book. There was much opportunity to give insight into why otherwise intelligent women would allow themselves to be manipulated by a sadist. The only character I could tolerate was Sutton, & he deserves a better book. It's as though 2 authors wrote this mess -- the author who emulated &#34;50 Shades&#34; & someone else with a brain.The book was a free download, so at least I didn't spend money on this, but it wasn't worth the time it took to read.

Seriously hot story about Alasdair, a 40 yr old divorced man who is introverted and a rule follower along with Iris, a 24 yr old beautiful girl with a sweet temperament and mysterious side. I loved them both and their chemistry was pretty electric. Iris only has eyes for Alasdair and she is very generous in sharing herself with him and not questioning his social awkwardness or requesting anything of him. Alasdair has always lived safely as an adult but never truly let himself go, yet he finds a side of himself that is much less controlled around Iris and it liberates him. The age difference is something Alasdair isn't comfortable with on a public eye level but he is starting to feel something for Iris although he isn't the romantic type and cannot express himself well but he surely isn't mistaking this for anything more than a partnership where they simply enjoy each other's company. They were both endearing and there's so many questions about Iris that remain unanswered especially since this story was in Alasdair's POV and he could not read her emotions. I'm so interested to learn more about Iris and the lonely girl inside of her in the next book.\", 'Very anxious to try some of these techniques, they give such a vintage look to the quilt.  Book looks very fun to use', \"Let me preface this review by saying I have read and enjoyed every book Grisham has written. Generally he is quite entertaining and the reader usually doesn't know what's coming at the end. Sadly, this book isn't up to the same quality of his other legal fiction.He starts with the suicide of a wealthy man who has just  written (as in ink on paper) a new will. The term holographic will should not be strange to any Grisham fan, as his earlier book, The Testament, begins the same way.I will try not to give away anything we learn at the end, although I will say i figured it out very early in this slow reading book. We do learn early on that there is an earlier will, prepared by some hotshot lawyers at a big out of town law firm. It leaves his assets to his kids and grandkids and uses the full extent of legal mumbo jumbo, tax planning and other legerdemain  to minimize the estate taxes due upon one's death. All well and good--the guy was smart, made a lot of money, and didn't want the taxman to get his mitts into his pile of cash. I liked the guy.So, if you have slogged through this book to the end, I'll ask you some simple questions:1. If you wanted to take care of someone, would you wait YEARS until you are literally dead before you did ANYTHING to help that person? There are a lot of ways to transfer assets/cash, with minimal tax consequences.2. If you wanted to leave someone your estate after death, why would you create a freakin' prior will and then hire Jake Brigance to fight the other beneficiaries because you never revoked that earlier will while alive? It would be INSANE to do this. If you hated your family, and Seth makes it clear he did, why ever sit down and create such a document? Even if you changed your mind after creating the first will, send the big shot law firm a notarized (or whatever) letter that simply says I revoke my will of such and such a date, signed Seth Hubbard. Have a nice day! Or go to their office in the flesh, whatever--it is your money and the lawyers are simply carrying out your wishes. You have the right to change your mind. Ask for the original out of their vault (yes there is a will vault) and tear it up with witnesses present. The ultimate revocation!3. Then, have that same hotshot law firm, using the same tax minimizing tricks, create a new will that leaves the money to your beneficiary of choice, again minimizing what the taxman collects, using generation skipping trusts, etc.. This is what a smart businessman like Seth Hubbard would have done.4. Even if you developed memory problems and had forgotten the address of the bigshot law firm, if you knew you were going to kill yourself and that there was definitely going to be a contest over the prior will (see above), why not go to a real lawyer, revoke the prior will and make another one? On the first few pages, we learn that Seth hated lawyers but liked Jake (by reputation). So get down to the Square in Clanton, have Jake make you a new will, which revokes the earlier one and creates new beneficiaries, and THEN go kill yourself.Finally, there are mysteries here, as to the WHY. Without revealing the who, what, when,... we do find out the answers toward the end. Seth does literally nothing to explain things to anyone before he dies, nor does he leave behind any documents that would explain why he did what he did. This is the same guy who buys a grave plot, arranges things with the undertaker, plans who will sing which hymn at his service and names his pallbearers. But he doesn't give any reason for why he leaves his fortune to his housekeeper. It remains for a third party to provide the explanation. Seth has a very valid reason--why on earth would he take that to the grave, knowing that it may remain a mystery for all time? For a guy we keep hearing about was really sharp and knew what he was doing, I really have my doubts.\", \"I'm glad this wasn't my first DB book:  I would never have picked up another.

If you have to mix a variety of ingredients in a bowl with a mixer and then &#34;dump&#34; them into a 9 x 13--not really a dump recipe unless one is using dump synonymously with pouring batter into a pan.

Her characters are tempting, sexy and her stories are addictive.  I believe the title gives you an idea of what this story involves and let me just say that once you pick this book up you won't be able to put it down.  Now you just have to read it for yourself to see what I'm hinting at.\", 'I feel like I am back from Iraq in full-fledged combat gear. This is a straight talk on war and our wounded warriors, with no embellishment, except for the four-letter words, but sans the four-letter words, the book loses much of its flavor. Kayla quotes (p. 235) Hermann Hesse: &#34;Who would be born must first destroy a world.&#34; Nonetheless, one had better remember what John Cornford said before the storming of Huesca at the height of the Spanish civil war: &#34;... crooked as the road that we must tread. Straight as our bullets fly ahead. We are the future. The last fight let us face.&#34; Kayla and Brian have won their last fight, and the one before the last. Three cheers to you folks.', \"A.M. Hargrove is an excellent author that writes Romance books, with not only the romance, but with mystery and real life issues involved. In Shattered Edge Justin and Terri try to start their relationship again and I have to say Terri is a true forgiver, with giving Justin another chance at her heart. Preston, Terri's brother, shows up and starts causing problems and ends up being more than just a problem in their relationship. Justin also has his issues with a psychotic stalker out to take out what she perceives as competition.I highly recommend Shattered Edge to anyone that likes mystery and action in their romance books.\", 'Exciting, riveting and well plotted. With each new chapter it was like peeling off a layer and finding something unexpected inside. Held my interest completely.', \"I don't like giving negative reviews. I try not to review anything I haven't read.  I TRIED to read it all the way through.  But... it begins with back story, and it just goes on and on... and on... and on.  It was like reading a diary where the writer has to tell you every single thing that happened to them that day-- in great detail.  I just couldn't finish it.  It was going nowhere.  The characters aren't likeable.  It DESPERATELY needs editing.  I just started scrolling through the book, skipping chapter after chapter in hopes it would be better soon.

I hope there will be another good book coming soon from this author.', \"I was intriuged by the premise and had my wife buy it for me Christmas.  It started off well, and I liked the idea of the story.  However, I found it to be WAY too much exposition and WAY too little plot.  A quarter of the way in, I got tired of reading about the explanation of the way the world works, with hardly anything happening.  The book is getting a lot of good reviews, but personally, I just don't see it.  It was just too much of a chore for me to read about this world (which really sucked me out of the suspension of disbelief, by the way, since there was far too much unneccesary info given to the main character and the reader in the exposition sections), and not entertaining enough.  This book was NFM..Not For Me.\", 'I dont understand what Anna wants.  Im lost and frustrated.  skimmed thru most of the story because it was boring.  It was unclear and confusing.

It was intelligent and well written with a good ending (better than several other distopian fiction  books I've read)\", \"I read this book for a book club. I love the cover and thought the idea was one that could have real insight into a troubled boy's journey through unfortunate circumstances. Instead, I could care less about this boy and found him and his loser friend, Boris, annoying. The inner monologues that go on for way too many paragraphs, found me skipping forward many times. Then the plot, which could have has some interesting twists, instead plodded...PLODDED...along until the outcome became pretty much what I anticipated.

We'll all be dead by 2030.\", \"DNF@37%There were just way to many issues with this novel for me to continue. I was interested in the overall plot but the execution was just too painful for me to continue. The reasons I could not finish this book are as follows;-Some parts are very realistic(like making the decision to not help someone/being selfish during the apocalypse) and other parts were bafflingly convenient.(Finding surplus of supplies)-Also one major gripe...I'm not a techie or anything but how the hell do you have internet access during the apocalypse! These are some seriously hardcore internet providers.- The narrative is split between first person and emails and for some reason the emails read as if they were written by an entirely different character(I'm guessing these were written by the second author but still).The two females in this story(both 26) already act like they are fifteen but the emails seemed as though they were written by a ten year old.- There was also a weird blas&eacute; regarding major events. There was never a single moment of disbelief over any of the crazy stuff that went down.Overall while the premise has promise the writing has too many flaws for the story to flourish.Note: I received this book for free in exchange for an honest review.\", \"The title was the first thing to draw me in. With a cute title I was expecting a cutesy romance, and while I got what I was expecting; I never imagined that I would be in tears from the very first page!!We start with Caleb saying his final goodbye to his wife, and I just knew that I wouldn't be able to walk away from this book!Abby is a kindergarten teacher and Caleb's little girl Madison is in her class, so they meet right off the bat. Mind you it has been four years since the wife's passing. Things are weird between them at first because they are both trying to fight their attraction to the other, while friends and family are scheming to hook them up!All the characters were well written and I found myself rooting for Abby, Caleb and sweet little Madison from the get go. I love that this story wasn't focused on the two main characters trying to get into each others pants, but the tension and love that was between them.The ending was very emotional for me, and I LOVED every minute of it.\", 'This would have been more helpful if actual photos were used. The armature drawings did not help understand at all.', \"I have really liked all of Emily Giffin's books. Her character development, writing style and themes have always been enjoyable and her books hard to put down. However, The One and Only is just awful. First, I understand that football is a character in the book but I feel she relies on it too much in lieu of developing her characters on a deeper level. I got bogged down by the endless amount of football statistics and discussion. The characters just didn't grab me and I found them difficult to relate with. Second, I was really hoping Shea wasn't going to develop a romantic relationship with the coach but it went there. If it weren't for the fact that they were like &#34;family&#34; and he was a father figure to her and messages of that nature were heavily emphasized early on, it would not have been bothersome. But the whole thing just felt very inscestual and VERY, VERY creepy. The main character has deep psychological issues regarding her relationships with men. I felt myself analyzing that throughout the book. It definitly is not a book I would suggest reading. Read a case study on the Electra complex instead.\", 'This book dragged on.

Danny is kind, a perfect gentleman, takes care of his gram, and is just all around a great guy; but he has a secret about his past and upcoming future and he tries so hard to deny Leah but it&#8217;s just impossible. Leah is wonderful, she does have a sad background but she&#8217;s strong willed and has always taken care of her family. She has so much strength and wit, she is just what Danny needs and vice versa. Their chemistry is fun and grows strong.&#34;I don't mind a little disappointment now and then. It just means you've got high standards. I'd rather shoot high and be disappointed sometimes than just live in the middle with the illusion of being satisfied.&#34;The supporting characters are great and add a lot to the story. Great relationships are formed and you are filled with warmth for them all.Danny & Leah have so much great banter when they are together you will be smiling through a lot of their scenes, but there is also the perfect mix of angst that has you anticipating throughout the entire book. Just when you think these two may finally get a break, hold onto your heart because it will be racing to the very end!This story was beautifully written and flows perfectly. I loved the mystery of it as well as the anticipation and hope. The story is powerful and Danny & Leah&#8217;s love was simply beautiful.\", 'Do not waste your time on this book. It goes no where and has a ridiculous ending. I did not enjoy the read, however I made myself finish it.', \"I did not like the heroine.  At all.  There is no excuse for stealing and, what is worse, she stole a two thousand year old book.  The hero offered to go with her (and bring the book) to Necropolis to decipher the symbols, but she did not want that because she felt uncomfortable around him.  She needed to get over herself.  I get that she wanted to stop the murders.  However, she did not have to bind him and steal the book.  It especially bothered me because she was slamming it on tables and touching it with her bare hands.  HELLO?!?  It was a 2000 year old book!  The disrespect she showed the ancient book and everything and everyone else (at least the part I read) was too much for me.  Stupid woman ended up having to work with him anyway, since she couldn't translate all of it.  I hate heroines like her and I'm not reading anymore.  I found the first two books in this series ok, but not great and was leery about this one, just based on the description.  I had a feeling the heroine was going to be a......um......witch.  But, I wanted to see what happened, since we were left hanging in the last book.  I should have gone with my instincts on this one.  Heroine was a zero.  I won't be reading anymore of this author's books.  I didn't like the first two enough to get past this horrible heroine and her stupidity.\", 'Though it does have lots of recipes, the book is not well written.  Definitely not good for the beginner soap maker.  Lots of recipes using difficult to find ( at least here in AK) and expensive oils.  Also uses warm method of soap making for many of the recipes, which is not a beginner thing to do. Can not recommend this book.', \"I'm a James Patterson fan from way back.  NYPD Red 2 was a great read. I don't usually backtrack but I'm going to make an exception and read NYPD Red now! :o)\", \"Too scary for meI probably won't order this aurhor again even tho I read the whole story to be sure.\", 'I finally figured out what was bothering be about Sacrificed in Shadow. As the first book of The Ascension Series, I thought I was getting in on the first of the series. See, I should have looked before I leaped &#8211; as The Descent Series is the actual first of the series. Now, I have to go back and read that series before I come back to this one.It makes sense now that I was lost throughout the book, though I suppose, stepping back, it was actually quite readable without starting at the very first. It was just that niggling feeling that I was somehow lost in the translation, like I should have known more about the characters, should have had a better feel for the interactions between Elise and the kopis, and Elise and the priest, Father Night. And, of course, the world building seemed off to me, not clarified enough. But, I was so into actually enjoying the book itself, and the unusual world it showed, I didn&#8217;t let it bother me too much. I loved Elise and how different she is as a character, how well developed she is. And the world itself and it&#8217;s mythology? I thought I would just learn more about it as time goes along. And, I have no doubt that, as with many series, if I just read Ascension, I would be fine and happy with the whole thing. It is very interesting, without a doubt.However, I am stopping and going to the first book of the Descent Series, Death&#8217;s Hand and starting over from there. If I am enjoying the story this much without the back-story, how much will I enjoy it with the back-story intact? This is some seriously good storytelling, and it will be well worth going back and starting over. In fact, I am totally excited by the thought! Besides, right now you can get the first three books of the Descent Series, Death&#8217;s Hand, The Darkest Gate, and Dark Union FREE at Amazon as a set: [...] so there is no reason not to start there, right?As I said, Sacrificed in Shadow was quite good on it&#8217;s own. Secrets, betrayal, hatred and love, all embroiled in a dark and sensual story of angels, demons, witches, and wolves. Ultimately, I was quite satisfied with my reading, but will be much more satisfied when I have the first series under by belt, so to say. Being that person who always goes back to read the first books in a series before reading the next to come out, I feel like a kid in a candy store, figuring out the series. Or, should I say a bibliophile at the end of the world, living out her life inside the New York Public Library, no worries, no interruptions, and all the books I could ever hope to read?', \"I liked the book, the topic was two-fold, holding onto your marriage when secrets have been kept from your mate and living with a special needs child. Both are difficult topics and they were handled very well by the author.I have to say, I put off reading this book for a couple of weeks after reading the first two. The topic, while handled very, well and not at all in a offensive manner still requires some investment in the emotions of the character and for the reader.I won't give a synopsis of the story, you should read the other two books, I do understand whey they were written as a trilogy and I highly recommend them, I just  couldn't read them one after the other. Well written and researched.\", \"I LOVED this book! Confession: I wasn't sure about the book so I borrowed it from the library first. Loved it so much I turned around and bought it.

The Undeniable series will always be my favorite MC series ever. Unbeloved is a 5 star book that you need to one-click.Dorothy and Hawk both love each other but we all know from the events in the other books that things are complicated for them. Unbeloved takes place seven years after Dorothy was shot. She has moved away from the club and only has minimal interaction with them when she has to.It takes a terrible event to set everything in motion for Hawk and Dorothy to be together. Just like the other books in the series their love is a real one and as we all know love is not always easy. I love this series and I will impatiently be waiting for the next book in the series to come out.PS: I almost cried at parts in this book so be prepared!!Happy ReadingXOXO R\", \"It getz no sweeter than this! 10 hot books!? are you kidding me!? thatz less than 30 cents each! gotta cop these so you'll be ready pool-side for the summer!

He has loved her all that time but still isn't over what his ex did to him? No romance to get the girl back after he decided he needed to be free before he could be with her, after he went after her. This book was a whole lot of words and not much of a story. Spent more time in the characters heads then interacting with each other and I found myself bored with the never ending over thinking on Kara`s part. This book was boring and not a fun read at all. I read other reviews that stated they got this book for free and felt I was ripped off for paying $2.99! My advice don't waste your money or time, even if this book wads free its not worth it.\", 'I have really enjoyed the first 3 books in the Brides of Cedar Creek  Series. This 3rd book so far is my favorite. It made my sad at times, butIt made my laugh a lot more then the others. Deborah is a great character and reminded me of someone from my days of youth. I hope the4th book is as good. I am happy I came across Mildred Colvin and her books.', \"I won't spend my time reading it.\", 'Well written and well edited story of unexpected quality. The main character is not your typical focus which helps to make this a very enjoyable read. While I am no history specialist the information certainly feels valid and well researched.

No compensation has been (or will be) received beyond the evaluation copy.', \"I only made it to the third page of the book.  It has sexually explicit language.  It would be nice of the book were to come with a warning label.  This book also makes light of Mormon beliefs.  I'm glad the book was free.\", \"Her Perfect Mate is Paige Tyler's first book in her X-Op series.  This book is a full length story...just thought I would mention it because most of Paige's published stories are novella's. This one took me a couple of hours to read...if not more cause there is a lot of detail in this book so I might of had to reread a couple of paragraphs just to make sure I understood the military terminology. I was pretty amazed by all the detail in the story. The book is cross between a action-adventure, romantic paranormal, and government agent thriller.In Her Perfect Mate, government agent Ivy Halliwell is paired with Special Forces agent Landon Donovan. Landon is not thrilled to be pulled from his current assignment but he gives the new partnership a chance.  Ivy is a &#34;shifter&#34; but in Paige Tyler's new X-Ops world, shifters don't shift into animals..they just share animal characteristics like better eyesight, hearing, etc.  I liked this new concept, found it unique and enjoyable.  Actually I found the whole story unique and different then what I have been reading lately.  Paige did a great job setting up a framework for future stories. Can't wait to read the next book in this new series. Highly recommend!!!\", 'I know I said this after reading last book in this series but I think this one is my favorite of the series! My new favorite I guess. ;) I&#8217;m totally allowed to change my mind. These just keep getting better IMO. I adored both the MCs. I was completely engaged in the first few pages. I enjoyed their first casual and somewhat seedy hook up in the park. It was hot but promised more to come.You may remember Michael from a previous book. No worries if you haven&#8217;t read the rest of the series. I think you can follow along just fine but they are good reads if you like this one, go back for the others. Micheal isn&#8217;t interested in getting involved with a closetted man, He has issues with them. Hook ups are another thing entirely. When he runs into Nicky at a party he learns a little bit more about him and finds out Nicky is firmly off his relationship list because of his fear of being outed. Neither can resist the spark that&#8217;s between and things move along pretty fast from there.I think Nicky not being out actually enhanced the overall heat of the sex scenes. There&#8217;s was this desperation to them. Kind of made them more urgent and needy to get a few minutes together to give into their desires. Things move beyond that to friendship and more fairly quickly which made things even better! Sex is hot but it&#8217;s so much hotter knowing they&#8217;re connecting in a way that&#8217;s more than just physical. In fact there wasn&#8217;t penetration sex for a good portion of this book but I honestly didn&#8217;t miss it I anticipated the moment it would happen.Nicky&#8217;s mom is terminal in this book. I think the author did a great job addressing this. It&#8217;s heavy subject matter and could easily overwhelm the story but I didn&#8217;t feel it did. She&#8217;s also very religious. I think these reasons gave a very real understanding of why Nicky isn&#8217;t out and why he can&#8217;t even think about starting a relationship with man at this point in his life. His fear is absolutely understandable. The way Michael handles all the things Nicky throws at him kind of makes me love him more. He&#8217;s scared of what he&#8217;s getting himself into but he knows he can&#8217;t walk away. They have a few blow ups but it&#8217;s a lot to take in pretty quickly. That&#8217;s actually another worry of theirs. Just a little more pressure for the guys! Reading about them working things out and falling in love consumed me for a few hours and isn&#8217;t that what we want out of a book? Another one I&#8217;d recommend picking up!Originally posted at &#34;live Your Life, Buy The Book&#34;', \"Kate and Henry - a wonderful couple, and their story was quite as emotionally wrenching as in the first book.  However, I'm not a big fan of flashback chapters (takes me out of the flow somehow), and Kate was a personality with very strong emotions indeed!I liked that Donaldson had a markedly different setting for her 2nd novel, with quite different heroines.  However I didn't quite empathize as much with Kate's emotional desperation and yearnings (as much as with Marianne's).  Still, the story and characters were strong enough to keep me reading right to the end in 1 night.  Can't wait for the next book!\", \"I didn't like this book at all.
