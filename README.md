# sentiment classification using nlp
this is repo is about automatic comments classfication either positive or negative .  python machine learning project using the sci-kit learn library. In it i tried to  build a model that automatically classifies text as either having a positive or negative sentiment. I build the models with different machine learning classification models.
ml classfication models used in this project:
1.suport vector classification(svc)
2.decision tree classifier
3.navie bayes classifier
4. logistic regreesion
I also tried evaluated all the models . I tried to tune the decision tree classifier model . Predicted the model with random test data and evaluated different metrics like accuracy and heatmap etc.
